# BattleOfWits
This game was a project in my cs introductory class where we used a web API to make a java application using the android studio IDE.
The game is trivia based one where users are able to choose a category, difficulty level, the number of questions they want for a particular session and how many seconds are allocated for each questions. 
The game then counts their current score and their best score.
